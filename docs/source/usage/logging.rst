Logging System
##############

Environment variables
---------------------

These environment variables can be used to change SAGA's logging behavior from 
the command line. Obviously, this can come in handy when debugging a problem
with an existing saga application. Environment variables are evaluated once 
during program startup. 

For example, if you want to see the debug messages that SAGA generates during 
program execution, you would set :envvar:`SAGA_VERBOSE` to ``DEBUG`` before you 
run your program::

    SAGA_VERBOSE=DEBUG python mysagaprog.py

.. envvar:: SAGA_VERBOSE

   Control the log level. This controls the amount of output generated by the
   logging system. Values can either be numeric (0-4) or a string (case 
   insensitive) representing the log level:

   +---------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+
   | Numeric Value | Log Level           | Type of Messages Displayed         |
   +===============+=====================+====================================+
   | 0             | ``CRITICAL``        | Only fatal events that will cause  |
   |               |                     | SAGA to abort. (default)           | 
   |               |                     |                                    |
   +---------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+
   | 1             | ``ERROR``           | Errors that will not necessarily   |
   |               |                     | cause SAGA to abort.               | 
   |               |                     |                                    |
   +---------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+
   | 2             | ``WARNING``         | Warnings that are generated by     |
   |               |                     | SAGA and its middleware adaptors.  | 
   |               |                     |                                    |
   +---------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+
   | 3             | ``INFO``            | Useful (?) runtime information     |   
   |               |                     | that is generated by SAGA and its  | 
   |               |                     | middleware adaptors.               |
   +---------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+
   | 4             | ``DEBUG``           | Debug message added to the code    |
   |               |                     | by the developers. (Lots of output)| 
   |               |                     |                                    |
